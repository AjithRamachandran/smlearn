smlearn
-------

**smlearn** is a python implementation of some fundamental machine learning algorithms.

The purpose of smlearn is not to produce optimized and efficient algorithms but rather to present how the algorithms work transparently.

*Currently in the developing phase. It is highly unstable and may change radically without notice.*

dependencies
------------

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= |PythonMinVersion|)
- NumPy (>= |NumPyMinVersion|)
